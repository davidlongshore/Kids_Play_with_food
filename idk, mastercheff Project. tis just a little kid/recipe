Shredded pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga; see Cook's Note)

For the yakisoba sauce: Whisk together the Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, sugar and soy sauce in a small bowl and reserve.

For the yakisoba: Place the noodles in a bowl, add about 1 teaspoon of the oil and stir to separate.

Heat the remaining oil in a skillet over high heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the pork belly and sear on all sides, about 3 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, onion and carrot and cook until tender but not cooked all the way, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cabbage and cook until almost tender, about 1 minute. Stir in the scallions and cook until slightly softened, about 30 seconds. Sprinkle in some pepper.

Add the noodles to the skillet and lower the heat to medium. Stir to warm and combine the noodles with the vegetables in the skillet for about 30 seconds. Stir in the yakisoba sauce and cook until the sauce is absorbed and distributed, about 1 minute. Plate up and top with the dried green seaweed and pickled red ginger if using.
